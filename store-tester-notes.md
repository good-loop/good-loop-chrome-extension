Hello

Test notes: 
The extension will prompt you to create a login (use any email) and pick a charity.
To use the extension - just open a blank new tab. 
The extension will display a nice picture, a search bar -- and a couple of banner ads at the bottom of the page. These raise money for the charity that you selected.
That's it :)

Thank you &
Kind regards,
 - Daniel
