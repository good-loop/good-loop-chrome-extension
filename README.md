# good-loop-chrome-extension

A chrome browser extension for Good-Loop and My-Loop

To install from a local git checkout:

1. `npm i`, `npm run compile` (or `watch.sh`)
2. Put <chrome://extensions/> in your browser
3. ...Switch on Developer Mode (it's a toggle in the top-right)
4. ...Click on "Load Unpacked"
5. ...Pick the `good-loop-chrome-extension/extension` folder to load.

You can test it by opening a new tab.

It should also nobble annoying consent scripts :)
